# JavaScript Debug Exercise

This is a collection of exercises for JavaScript debugging.
All exercises are Express apps written in plain JavaScript.
Bugs may exist within the Express server, or the JavaScript running in the browser.
Each exercise has its own `README.md` which explains what you should be looking for.
To start a server just run the following command within any of the exercise folders:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open the URL `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
It is also possible to use a different port like this:

```bash
PORT=3050 npm start
```
